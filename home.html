Your looks theaten me.
Those eyes moving up and down
my physicality.
Mouths whispering as I pass by
and telling lies and assumptions 
left unproven.
Those grin, those smiles turning into laughter, all for my failures and mistakes. <br>How I wish.
How can I wish to be capable if I'm incapable?
Incapable of smiling. 
Incapable of dressing up with my style.
Incapable of talking loud and to be heard.
Incapable of looking.
Incapable of moving.
How can I? When all I am capable of is just to cry.
Cry silently, cry dry since no tears are left.
Cry as the pain numb me off.
How can I? If all I can do freely is to cry.</p>

With all chaos turning the colorful planet into black and white, is there still humanity?
Everything on Earth is significant for each and everyone. The waters are for the fish to live in, air is for the flowers to dance, as well as a tree for humans to breathe. But, sad to say, man's humanity have lost its pitch. <br>Trees are the most abused thing on Earth. From its fruits provided for man's satisfaction, its trunks for man's shelter, its branches and twigs for man's furnitures, and even its leaves for everything we need, from its head-to-toe everything's held<br>We are the real monsters for we don't know when to stop, and we don't settle until getting anything capable to satisfy our needs. We are good at nothing but getting benefit by all means. Enough is not a word, but a last resort. When will we stop? When the air we breathe isn't that fresh anymore? When will we learn? How can we see if we're blinded by greed and wants. Can we even change if the last tree falls in our hands?</held></p>

      							<h2 class="modal__heading2">Bloody Head</h2>
      							<p class="modal__paragraph2">This is a story of a girl who became a person's rage. It started with a good and strong friendship which isn't supposed to last shortly. She has been my childhood friend, my bestfriend and my sister. I treated her as a family, we grew together and learned each other's story. Since then, she knew my fear and hatest thing to encounter-having rival. Years passed by and we tend to barely see each other, with the unreachable distance and loads of responsibilities to do.  After few years, this little simple reunion of the two of us is unexpectedly a double date for we both found our knight in shining armor-our childhood dream. Seeing her excites me, and meeting my bestfriend's man is a lot more exciting. Still, I bet my man's way better than hers, i have a better taste when it comes to guys. Calmly and happily, I waited for them in the reaserved table in this high-end looking restaurant. Yes, I'm alone for now since my man has a quick errand to attend. Few minutes more and there! I saw my long time no see bestfriend slash sister. Yet what makes me thrilled is to see my man coming together with her. Shock was seen in our faces, but I guess my bestfriend haven't noticed yet. I can feel the heat, I can feel my blood accelerating and everything inside me is like a volcano ready to pump out hot-killing lava. I managed to gather up myself and remain calm and pretend nothing happened. All I know for sure is I hate her, I hath them, and I want revenge. After that heartbreaking dinner of mine and heartwarming dinner of theirs, she insists to sleep at my place. How lucky am I to gladly approve. <br> I let her lay down in the couch, stared at her and my heart came back to its sences. I want revenge, that's all my heart says. Without a doubt I straightly went to the kitchen and got the knife. I went to my room and got some sewing kit. And I began my happiness. Fastly, I sew her mouth to make her unable to scream and made her eyes bleed. I got a cup and got all her dripping blood. Well, I think this will be a good wine to give her man a congratulatory wine for their upcoming wedding... with the dead.</p>

      							<p class="modal__paragraph3"> Clowns are the greatest happiness to other people. They give you surprises that you won't ever forget. But are they really happy? Do they enjoy their job as a clown? Clowns are very strong in a way that they did not even show what they really feel, what if they are really sad or they have problems but they still make jokes to other poeple just to make them happy. Clowns have the biggest sadness. A clown will work hard for his family, He will disregard his problems just to do his job well, and to make someone happy. He will cover his eyes, as he cover his feelings. He will pretend to be happy, because he is a clown. It's his job.</p>
